      "my earliest memory is being in a car with my mother . she has a handful of my hair , & is slamming my head against the window while screaming at me . i do not understand why . my mother continued using physical violence or the threat of it on me until i was 14 . she raised her hand threatening to hit me & even though she was still bigger than i was ( * she was 5 ' 10 ” , i was maybe 5 ' 4 ” at the time * ) i had enough . i simply said : “ no fucking way , not again , not ever . if you want to hit me , go ahead , but i am going to hit you back with everything that i have . * ” after that , over the next 20 years until she died , i can count the number of times she was physically violent with me on one hand & while i never did make good on my promise to punch her , i did respond with speed & violence to restrain her & make it damn clear that not only was it unacceptable but that if she was wanted to go that route , she was going to lose & badly . i am the only one of her children who ended up \u001b[1m\u001b[94mtaller\u001b[0m than her & as i am a large man , it was n't difficult for me to dominate her in such a situation . fortunately for me , that show of force & will was enough to deescalate the situation & being her back to reason because i honestly do n't know what i would have done if it had n't or how i would have lived with myself afterwards . as for my relationships . i have not had a single serious relationship where my partner was not violent with me . i have never , not even once , been violent with any one of them or used my strength for anything other than restraining them to prevent them from attacking me . it took me until my late 20s to realize that this was n't normal & was n't acceptable but even a decade later when i started dating my erstwhile wife , i struggled to stand my ground , struggled with feeling i deserved it & feeling that it was n't a big deal because i could take it . i mean , she was half my size , it was n't like she could really hurt me , it was really hard to come to the realization that it was n't the point . it did n't matter if she could or could not “ hurt ” me , no person should have to accept being attacked , beaten & degraded by someone who claims to love them . when i finally was able to convince myself of that , & call my wife out for her abusiveness , she agreed to go into therapy & for a while she made amazing progress . unfortunately , as time passed , she started going back to her old patterns ( * of physical , emotional & verbal abuse * ) until one day she told me that she was n't going to continue with her therapy because it was really all just my fault & her abusive behaviors were justified by my failings as a husband . i was then & am still now , completely , madly , head over heels in love with her but i filed for a separation the next day . when i gave her the papers , i told her that i still loved her , that i do not believe in divorce & had no intention of divorcing her , but i could not accept her abusive behavior & if she was n't going to be in therapy to work on those issues , i needed to separate myself to protect myself . her response was : “ * you do n't get to leave me , i 'm the one who should be leaving you . * ” 90 days later she filed to convert the separation into a divorce , i refused to sign the paperwork because i do n't believe in divorce & i knew that my signature was n't needed anyway . she has n't spoken to me since & i am heart broken . she is the love of my life but as much as i desperately want to have a relationship with her , i could n't continue * * that * * relationship & she chose her pride & her anger over our marriage so there was no option to have a healthy relationship with her . i doubt i 'll ever have another relationship , not because i am bitter , jaded or resentful rather that because the vows i made meant something to me , i do not make promises that i can not & will not keep . no man , no woman , nor god or court of law can change , alter or remove the vows i took & the vows i will keep . she is my wife , until death do us part . for me , the fact that we are separated , that we are not talking , that so court or some piece of paper says she is no longer my wife , does n't change my vows , it just mean she is being a shitty wife .\n",

      "no , i asked because i can't help with the financial part . i 'm spoiled and my family paid tuition , haha . i can help with the psychological aspect ! so , first off , my main issue was feeling like i was so behind . i could n't see the positive side of my situation . i dropped out of high school and started college in my early 20s , transferred to a prestigious private uni to study engineering , and still felt like a failure because i did n't have the 18-22 college experience i “ should 've ” had . when you graduate , you 're not gonna be a person that finished college late . you 're just gonna be a college grad . try to remember that , be kind to yourself , and try to make peace with the fact that you have your own personal timeline and it does not reflect on your intelligence , dedication , or value as a person . i recommend reaching out to other non-traditional students . try to look for gi bill students , second bachelor 's students , any group that tends to be older . you can even try meeting some grad students ! i was young enough to get along with traditional-aged students , but social isolation can be very difficult and it should be a priority to try and find people closer to your age so you do n't feel so alone . seeing people your age and older excel and enjoy life as fellow students is great for your self-esteem . i met quite a few people in their mid-late 20s , a decent amount in their 30s , even some in their 40s . this was at a private uni and non-traditional students are less likely to attend private unis , so public unis and community colleges should have many , many more older students . you will definitely not be alone . academically , try to remember not to compare yourself to your traditional-aged peers because you 're not a traditional student . they 've been in school mode their whole lives , but you paused school mode to work , take care of adult matters , raise kids , or do whatever it was you did before you went back to school . it can take some time to get back into the swing of things . you do n't need straight as , just being able to hold down the fort is amazing enough . i had to teach myself several years worth of math and science to get on the same level as my peers and maintain a 4.0 , i regret sacrificing years of happiness ( and sleep ... and a social life ... and basic self care ) for straight as . going to college is awesome at any age . you will be okay . take care of yourself , be proud , and remember a \u001b[1m\u001b[91mdegree\u001b[0m can only help you in the long run .\n",

      "that 's not bad , but you 're still not being realistic . you have very little muscle . you are going to lose some of it if you do an intense 2 month diet and workout routine . you will look skinnier and less muscular at the end . do n't even worry about preserving your muscle or building it in a recomp while you 're getting ready for your wedding . it 's too many things to think about and you can easily fuck it up and end up not gaining muscle or losing weight . just stay active like you 're doing , lift , and stop eating so many calories . even losing 5 to 10 pounds is going to make a big difference in how a \u001b[1m\u001b[94msuit\u001b[0m hangs off you .\n",
